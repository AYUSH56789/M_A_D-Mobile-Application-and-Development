# Android Development Environment Practical

## Introduction
This practical file aims to study the design aspects of the Android development environment, with a focus on setting up Android Studio. Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development.

## Objectives
- Understand the design and features of Android Studio.
- Learn how to set up Android Studio on your computer.
- Create a simple Android application to test the development environment.

## Prerequisites
- A computer with internet access.
- Basic understanding of programming concepts.

## Materials
- Android Studio installation file
- JDK (Java Development Kit)

## Steps to Setup Android Studio

### 1. Downloading Android Studio
1. Go to the official [Android Studio download page](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. Click on the "Download Android Studio" button.
3. Accept the terms and conditions and start the download.

### 2. Installing Android Studio
1. Open the downloaded file to start the installation process.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. This includes choosing the installation path, components to install, and setting up the environment variables.

### 3. Configuring Android Studio
1. Launch Android Studio.
2. On the welcome screen, click on "Configure" and then select "SDK Manager".
3. Download and install the required SDK packages and tools.
4. Set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) by going to "AVD Manager" and creating a new virtual device.

### 4. Creating a Simple Android Application
1. Open Android Studio and select "Start a new Android Studio project".
2. Choose a project template (e.g., Empty Activity) and click "Next".
3. Configure the project by specifying the name, package name, and save location, then click "Finish".
4. Wait for Android Studio to set up the project environment.
5. Once the project is set up, open the `MainActivity.java` file and modify the `onCreate` method to display a simple "Hello, World!" message.

### Example Code
```java
package com.example.helloworld;

import android.os.Bundle;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.widget.TextView;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        TextView textView = new TextView(this);
        textView.setText("Hello, World!");
        setContentView(textView);
    }
}
